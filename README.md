FILE-2-JSON
=====================

Purpose
---------------

FILE-2-JSON looks to connect several NodeJS libraries together with the purpose of converting HTML, HTM, PDF documents, etc into JSON objects that can then be uploaded to Algolia, the search engine solution software.  

Current State
---------------

At its present state, it'll convert PDFs and HTML documents, assigning a **headings** and **content** key to the values returned.
