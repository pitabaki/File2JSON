The Farallon plate was forced under the American plate and large amounts of rock were left behind. One, serpentinite, is a very rare rock type that is found at Edgewood. This underlying rock is a very unique feature of the Park that can be observed in the serpentine grasslands and rock outcroppings.The vegetative history of Edgewood reflects numerous geologic and climatic changes. Relics of Neotropical forest (California Bay Laurel, California Buckeye), Actotertiary forest (Coastal Redwood, Douglas Fir) and Madroteriary forest (Madrone, Manzanita, and Poison Oak)are found there.The human history of the region shows that hunters were in the region 6,000 years ago. About 500 AD. Ohlone speaking peoples came to the bay area. Two Ohlone archeological sites have been found nearby, one at Filoli Estates and one at Phleger Estates. In 1769, the Spanishexploring party of Gaspar de Portola marched through the region and made the first Ohlone-Spanish encounter.TrailsThere are 5 trails throughout Edgewood Park and Natural Preserve: Edgewood Trail (1.93 Miles), \r\nSerpentine Loop (1.94 miles), Ridgeview Loop (1.38 miles), Clarkia Trail (.74 Mile), and the Sylvan Loop (2.5 Miles). The Sylvan Trail is an exercise loop for runners, joggers, and hikers. No horses are allowed on this trail.Trails leading into the park are located at Edgewood and Canada Road (Canada Trail Head), on Sunset and Hillcrest (Sunset Trail head), on Sylvain Way; closed at this time (Sylvan Way Access), and at the main entrance of Edgewood (Old Stage Trail Head).It is always required that equestrians and hikers stay on the marked trails, particularly in the open meadow and grassland areas where endangered plants and animals may exist. Please respect your fellow trail users and follow the guidelines for safe and courteous trail use.FacilitiesEdgewood Park and Natural Preserve has one main area where facilities are located. Located within this area are restrooms, a meadow area, an amphitheater, and three drop-in family picnic areas. An interpretative center is planned in the future for the Old Stage Day Camp area.ActivitiesDocent-lead wildflower walks, provided by the Friends of Edgwood, are held in the spring of each year.  These walks explore the magnificent flower displays of Edgewood, including many rare species.  The walks take place on Saturdays and Sundays, generally from mid-Marchthrough mid-June.Monthly bird walks, led by a Sequoia Audubon Society docent, also take place at Edgewood throughout the year.
