Meyer Sound has officially announced the release of the latest member of the LEO Family: LEOPARD!. There is enormous excitement surrounding this product.   But wait--there’s more! The 900-LFC joins the 1100-LFC as the latest addition to Meyer Sound’s LF Series of products in the LEO Family. The 900-LFC is a neutral, ultralow distortion loudspeaker that provides unparalleled low-frequency immersion in a compact package. Join us at Prolight + Sound in Frankfurt (April 15–18) and Sound:Check in Mexico City (April 26–28) to meet LEOPARD and the 900-LFC and see them join LYON, LEO, and the 1100-LFC as members of the LEO Family.   But wait! There is still more. This month sees the release of MAPP XT, the newest version of Meyer Sound’s powerful and accurate system design tool. A host of new features are available in MAPP XT. There is a product tutorial video available introducing MAPP XT and answering the questions “What’s new?” Accompanying webinar sessions are also scheduled for April 29.
