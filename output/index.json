Perpetually a student, I enjoy learning about 3 major facets of my industry: the user’s experience, the graphical interface, and the programming languages that support them. Project Role: Front-end Development, Design Consultant Company: 1Ingress Summary: 1Ingress, a startup based out of Walnut Creek, approached me with a design for their website that they were looking to have developed. Working directly with the designer, I acted as a consultant in refining the user interface and user's experience of their website — in mockup form, I gave feedback and made suggestions when elements worked and didn't work within their design — as well as acted as the sole front-end developer in writing a prototypical version of their website.The entire process was team-driven. Weekly to bi-weekly, designs were published in a shared online storage space by the designer. From there, the designer and I would meet to go over the designs thoroughly and as a team, pointing out and marking when elements, such as the placement of buttons or the leading of text, were working for the overall design and when they fell short. From there, I'd markup and style, in HTML and CSS, the webpage for browser preview to test for functionality and ease-of-use. JavaScript and jQuery scripts were written for interactive elements and dynamic content.
