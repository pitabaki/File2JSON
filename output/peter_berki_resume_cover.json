With a background in design — with many years working alongside web development teams \r\n— and years in experience of programming with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — building apps and websites \r\nfor not-for-profits and for-profits alike — I believe I would be a valuable asset to what I see as an already \r\nstrong development team.\r\nPrior to graduating university, I worked several projects/jobs creating content to support web \r\ndevelopment. During my stint in Orange County, I worked at a production house creating graphics — both \r\nmotion and static — for output to the web. During that time, I worked with the web developer to create \r\nFlash graphics and style web pages with CSS. \r\nIn University, I took all of the web development courses required within my college. Over a period of \r\ntwo years, I strengthened my knowledge of HTML and CSS, studied style frameworks like bootstrap, and \r\nembarked on learning JavaScript — my primary language when it comes to writing scripts.\r\nPost-graduation, I studied JavaScript on my own time, incorporating it when I could in my work at Meyer \r\nSound (the company I worked for after graduating). In the evenings, I would attend Meetups and other \r\nevents to become a bit more acquainted with the language and to learn about trends within the industry. \r\nI took classes to learn the basics of structuring code, as well as perfect my writing syntax. From there, \r\nI began listening to podcasts, reading blogs, quizzing myself on algorithms — just solving problems in \r\ngeneral — to further my understanding of scripting for the web.\r\nI’m very passionate about development, but I often look at the industry with a different perspective than \r\nother developers. I don’t exclusively look for ways to save on load times — I also want the interaction \r\nbetween the user and the application/website to feel natural. So I’ll often study human interaction as well \r\nas new frameworks and technologies for web development (I’m often seen at HTML5 and App Meetups).\r\nMy design background shouldn’t seem like a hinderance to my ability to learn new Front-End \r\nDevelopment skills — as the tools evolve, I, too, acknowledge the need to continue learning and adapting.\r\nI see this position as a chance for me to grow as a developer, and to accompany a collection of designers, \r\ndevelopers, project managers, etc in growing Tradeshift as a whole.\r\nThank you for your time. I look forward to hearing back from someone at Tradeshift.\r\nSincerely, \r\nPeter Berki\r\nPeter Berki\r\nVisual Designer / Front-End Developer\r\n1450 27th.
